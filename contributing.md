# Contributing

Thank you for empowering open source by using our project! It's people like you that keep the software community thriving and relevant. Your contribution means a lot to us!

Our documentation site runs on NextJS and uses TailwindCSS for styling. [Go to the documentation repository]() to see more about how you can make our docs better by contributing.

## Getting started

Assuming you already have Node installed on your machine run the following commands in your working directory:

```bash
# Creating our working directory
mkdir huetiful && cd huetiful

```

On this step its a matter of preference to either use git clone for cloning the repository. Personally, I prefer `npx degit` because it is simpler:

```bash
#  Cloning the repository. It will populate your current working directory with all the files in the repository
npx degit prjctimg:huetiful

```

Install the necessary dependencies needed to setup the development environment and then run the build script to have the current builds added to  a `dist/` folder

```bash
npm install --save-dev

npm run build

```

## Coding conventions and task automation

This project uses [Husky]() for Git hooks. For example, the code can only be committed if it passes linting tests which are done using [ESLint](). For the code to be pushed to the remote branch it must build without errors on your local machine. This helps maintain sanity and reduce chances of introducing buggy code o the project. All code is automatically formatted when you run `git push` as a pre-push hook.

## Issue tracking

Our issues are partly managed by GitHub Actions. For example when you open a new issue an automated response is sent to you telling you how to proceed. You can also self assign yourself an issue or task if you want to work on it. This helps other maintainers focus on improving other aspects of the project.
