//  Hue linearity is when a color changes hue due to changes in the chromaticity in color spaces that are designed to be hue linearised.

const hueLinearity = () => {
  // Divergent palette takes the lighter variants of a color in the middle.
  // Using hue linearity I could get the color on the other extreme linear end and map
};
