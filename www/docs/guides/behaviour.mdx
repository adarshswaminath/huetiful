## Introduction

Whenever possible, the library passes internal defaults to make sure that the least amount of errors surface unnecessarily. 

For example all `options` objects are optional but in certain scenarios these options have to be specified to remove ambiguity.

:::tip

In this article when I say color object I mean a color token defined either as an `Array` instance or plain object.

### Color parsing behaviour


:::caution 

A good example is with `token()`, if you pass in the color token as an array or plain object without the `mode` specified it will treat the color as if it is in the mode `'rgb'`. This can lead to incorrect final results or error.

```ts

import { token } from 'huetiful-js';



// c1 is an array of RGB channels
const c1 = [0.8, 0.5, 0.3],
	// c2 is an array of LCH channels.
	// Its treated as RGB and normalized to the range [0,1]
	// if normalizeRgb is true
	c2 = [80, 55, 30],
	// this works because the default srcMode is rgb
	c3 = { r: 0.8, g: 0.5, b: 0.3 },
	// this just produces black because the default channel keys 
	// differ from the color token's
	c4 = { l: 80, c: 55, h: 30 };

const res = [];
for (const c of [c1, c2, c3, c4]) {
	res.push(token(c));
}

console.log(res)

// [ '#cc804dff', '#50371eff', '#cc804dff', '#000000ff' ]

```

Always try to define the mode of your color objects (be it arrays or plain objects) or explicitly via the `srcMode` property if your omit it from the color object.


:::

The `srcMode` is inferred from the passed in color token during parsing in the following order of precedence:

0. A `mode` property (if `object`) or the first element (if `Array`) which is expected to be of type `string`.


1. If the color token is of type `string` (regardless its a CSS named color, serialized color string or hex), `number` or `boolean` then the mode is `'rgb'`.

However in utilities that perform hue dependant operations like `hueshift()`, then the default colorspace is `lch`.

:::caution

The `srcMode` property will override the color object's `mode`.

```ts
// the mode will be 'lab'
const c1 = ['lch',65,38,19,0.3]

token(c1,{ srcMode:'lab',kind:'arr' })

// ['lab',65,38,19,0.3]

```

### Default `baseColor` for palette generators

Every utility that takes an individual color token (known as `baseColor`) provides `'cyan'` as the default color.


### Default `options` for collection utilities

For every utility that takes an `options` object, its internally guarded with default parameters to ensure that you can customize just what you want and let the rest be.

## Common errors

The sources of bias when manipulating color are nuanced and sometimes not immediately obvious.


### Why am I only getting achromatic (grey) colors ?

One of the bugs I encountered was when I got gray colors if I tried to interpolate via black.
 The bug stemmed from the fact that black has an `undefined` hue channel therefore all the resulting colors would have `NaN` as their hue channel value. The way around this was to explicitly pass all channels as `0` in the target hue based colorspace.


### Generated color samples are a bit off

At the mopment there's inevitable precision loss when converting across certain colorspaces. This can slightly alter the final result of the color. In the future, I may provide a fix for this.
