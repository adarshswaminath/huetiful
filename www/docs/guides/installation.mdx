:::note 

Note that the library is ESM only. If you want a UMD build you'll have to clone the repository and build from source. Here's a link to the [contributing.md](https://github.com/prjctimg/huetiful/tree/main/contributing.md) for instructions on setting up the project locally.


:::

Assuming you already have Node installed, you can use your preferred package manager to install:

```bash
# npm
npm i huetiful-js

# yarn
yarn add huetiful-js

# pnpm
pnpm add huetiful-js

```

### In the browser and via CDNs

You can use also a CDN in this example, jsdelivr to load the library remotely:

```ts
import {...} from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/huetiful-js/build/huetiful.esm.js'

```

:::tip

You can also [download from GitHub](https://github.com/prjctimg/huetiful/releases/latest) directly as an archive.
