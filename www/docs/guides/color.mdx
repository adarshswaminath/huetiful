# Introduction

In the context of this project, we define a color as being any JavaScript type (`string`,`number`,etc) that can be parsed to a CSS supported format, like hex. The functionality of this library builds on the assumption that colors can be parsed and manipulated to and from different types which allows us to have the color token at a represantation that is convenient for us. 


## Types of color tokens

Being able to parse our colours from different formats allows us to get creative with color programmatically. Inspired by the `chroma()` constructor in chroma-js, the library exports a function called `token()` which parses color tokens to other representations.

Below is a list of the supported types which are treated as valid color tokens.



### CSS compatible color formats

> This library uses Culori, a powerful function oriented library for general purpose color manipulatios behind the scenes to handle color conversion

All CSS recognized color formats are supported:


```ts




```


### Arrays

Color tokens can also be parsed from array whereby its (excluding the optional `mode` string) elements are treated as being valid channel values. The manner in which the array's elements are passed in determines the behaviour `token()` will show.

Below are the valid formats for passing a color as an array.


```ts



```



### Plain objects

Supported by Culori under the hood, objects can be used to represent a color as well, the author explains this in the docs. 


### Numbers

Any valid JavaScript number can be converted to an RGB color object if it's in the range of `0` to `16,277,215`. 

Below is an example of parsing color from different number types.


```ts



```


### And yes even booleans

As a bonus `true` returns pure white (`#ffffff`) whilst `false` returns pure black (`#000000`)


```ts



```


## Color theory at the heart of it all...

Distinguishing colors from one another using observable properties (mainly hue,chroma and lightness) is easy with the human eye. But how do we tell an achromatic (gray) color apart from a colorful one ? Most colors are a mixture of 2 or more hues, how do we tell which hue is biasing (overtoning) a color for example, cyan ?

By paying attention to the color token, we can get very creative with color in our designs.
