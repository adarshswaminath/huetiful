### Slimmer API

Prior to v3 the API was not very DRY, with utilities being over specialised for one particular task. Here's an example:

```ts

```

### "One parser to convert them all"

Initially each color token type had a standalone converter function. 

```ts


```

All these functions have been merged into one function, `token()` which can parse and output color tokens in different types:


```ts




```

### Method chaining with `color()` and `load()`

Method chaining allows a more concise and readable syntax than nesting functions inside of each other.


```ts


// An example showing the same operation but with different syntaxes

```

### Smaller bundle 

The library now supports a limited number of colorspaces because the mode definitions make the bundle really large.

:::tip

See the Culori docs for [more information on colorspaces](https://culorijs.org/guides/tree-shaking/#culori-css) that are included by default. 
For conversion across many colorspaces use the Culori library instead.

:::


 Below is an exhaustive list of supported colorpaces:


 ```ts

export type Colorspaces =
	| 'lab'
	| 'lab65'
	| 'rgb'
	| 'lch'
	| 'lch65'
	| 'xyz65'
	| 'xyz'
	| 'rec2020'


 ```

 ### Sorting and filtering with customizable options

 Prior to v3, each `factor` had a sorting and filtering function. This made the code unnecessarily complicated and hard to maintain. Now, we can customize the sorting/filtering behavior through an `options` object.


 ```ts

import { sortBy, filterBy } from 'huetiful-js'

// sorting





// filtering




 ```

 ### A few more `collection` methods

 The library now comes with 2 new experimental functions for manipulating collections:
 
 #### `stats()`

 This function gets the statistics for a collection of color tokens alongside some extra meta which can be useful when you want to know certain info before making a decision during color manipulation. It also has an `options` object to customize how the stats are calculated.



```ts


```
 
 
 #### `distribute()`

 As the name suggests, this function opens a new avenue of creativity by distributing the specified `factor`s equally amongst other color tokens in the collection. Its behaviour can also be customized by passing an options object.

 :::tip

If you think this function can be further improved, [open an issue](https://github.com/prjctimg/huetiful/issues/new) on the project repository alongside some suggestions you may have in mind!

 ### Better types and code examples

 The library is written in TypeScript for better editor autocomplete support and type definitions for the API. The code examples have also been updated to be more simple and straightforward.

Made something cool out of this ? You can share it [on my Twitter](https://x.com/prjctimg). 

I'd love to see what can be built with this project!
