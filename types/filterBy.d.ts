/**
 * Filters a collection of colors using the specified `factor` as the criteria. The supported options are:
 * * `'contrast'` - Returns colors with the specified contrast range. The contrast is tested against a comparison color (the 'against' param) and the specified contrast ranges.
 * * `'lightness'` - Returns colors in the specified lightness range.
 * * `'chroma'` - Returns colors in the specified `saturation` or `chroma` range. The range is internally normalized to the supported ranges by the `colorspace` in use if it is out of range.
 
 * * `'distance'` - Returns colors with the specified `distance` range. The `distance` is tested against a comparison color (the 'against' param) and the specified `distance` ranges. Uses the `differenceHyab` metric for calculating the distances.
 * * `luminance` - Returns colors in the specified luminance range.
 * * `'hue'` - Returns colors in the specified hue ranges between 0 to 360.
 *
 *
 * For the `chroma` and `lightness` factors, the range is internally normalized to the supported ranges by the `colorspace` in use if it is out of range.
 * This means a value in the range `[0,1]` will return, for example if you pass `startLightness` as `0.3` it means `0.3 (or 30%)` of the channel's supported range.
 * But if the value of either start or end is above 1 AND the `colorspace` in use has an end range higher than 1 then the value is treated as is else the value is treated as if in the range `[0,100]` and will return the normalized value.
 *
 * @see https://culorijs.org/color-spaces/ For the expected ranges per colorspace.
 *
 * Supports expression strings e.g `'>=0.5'`. The supported symbols are `== | === | != | !== | >= | <= | < | >`
 *
 *
 * @param {Factor} factor The factor to use as a filtering criteria.
 * @param {number|string}  start The minimum end of the `factor` range.
 * @param {number|string} end The maximum end of the `factor` range.
 * @returns Array of filtered colors.
