## Interpolating colors

Culori has support for spline based interpolation methods that have 3 types at the time of writing; `natural`, `monotone` and `basis`. Each type has a `closed` variant that can be useful for creating cyclic color scales.

The library has several utilities that take advantage of this functionality to create custom color scales and a wrapper function over the `interpolate` function that allows to easily specify per channel interpolation method (if necesary)
However, certain interpolation methods will throw `NaN` if you use colors such as pure black or pure white which have `undefined` hue channels. This means that if you interpolate any of these colors with a chromatic color you'll end up with gray colors instead of a color transition as you would expect!  Consider the example below:

```js


```

To address this issue the color black and white can be treated specially by passing 0 to the undefined channels:


```js


```
