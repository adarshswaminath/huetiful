# huetiful-js

## Open source TypeScript library for general purpose color manipulations and generating custom color scales

The aim🎯 of this project is to help designers👩🏻‍🎨 and developers👩🏾‍💻 alike to  work with color🎨 more programatically using functions based on color theory. Though not necessarily a requirement, a basic background of color spaces, properties of color and any other color theory related information will make the library's use cases appear more simpler.

### Getting started⛳

This project is split into two parts:

### `source/`

This is where we find the library source code. It contains the code bundled as an [npm package for this library]().

### `webapp/`

This is where the API documentation and demo app lives.

### Demo👀

[See the demo webapp in action]() demonstrating some of the package's functionalities.

### Contributing👐🏾

This project is fully open source so contributions are greatly appreciated! Each package in this monorepo has its own contribution guidelines. For [contributions towards the library's source code go here]() else [go here if you wish to contribute to the webapp]().
