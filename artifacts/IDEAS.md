# Some ideas I have been thinking of.

- An SVG art generator.
- A gradient generator with options to adjust easings, interpolation methods and switch color spaces.
- Add a color tile page for all the available colors
- Show an example for a few palette funcs

## What will I need ?

- A preview component that can be resized and customized
- A control panel for containing the buttons or inputs for adjusting params

### What else do I need to know ?

- I need to tab the tools 
- Each tab must follow the same design guidelines for defining common actions.

### Landing page 
- Use a flowfield that has hue shifted colors per particle (I need to fix max_iterations in hueShift)
- Use an animated gradient div at the footer.
