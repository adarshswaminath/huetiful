# Demos

This page has some basic examples of what some of these functions will output when we render the results. Code is always a work in progress so feel free to open an issue if you notice anything incosistent.

The functions used in this page are the ones that return an actual `ColorToken` or `collection` of such.

### Where do the examples live ?

The data for these demos is mapped from the library's `.spec` or test files. [See the spec files here]()
