<h1 class="font-extralight ">It's not just <span class="text-pink-600">another library</span>  about <span class="text-sky-600">color.</span></h1>

The current color manipulation libraries out there focus on working with one color token at a time. But we don't have time and we need you to sort and curate 16,000 color samples:

<!-- @import "[TOC]" {cmd="toc" depthFrom=1 depthTo=6 orderedList=false} -->

### Function oriented API with a hint of OOP

Developers have always had unique preferences. Choose between method chaining or nesting your functions the traditional FP way:

```js

```

### Query color properties and make design decisions based on the outcome

Wish to know the values or properties of a certain color before you map it to an SVG element to be rendered on the screen ?

```js
//Use Rune.js
```

### Compute values of statistical significance from collections

We have a collection of mixed colors and we want the color with the smallest hue angle.

```


```

### Sort and filter collections of color according to their properties

Manipulate collections of colors using their properties as the criterion:

```js

```

### Retrieve static color scales from well curated sources

The library bundles colors from TailwindCSS, and colorBrewer to give you a starting point for color collections to work with:

```js

```

### Create custom color scales and palettes

Craft color scales like a true pro by taking control of your easing,interpolation methods and color stops:

```js

```

We can even curate classic palettes from collections of color:

```js

```
