## What is this ?

[huetiful-js](https://github.com/xml-wizard/huetiful) to makes it simple and straight forward to manipulate color either
as individual tokens or collections. It builds off where libraries like chroma.js and d3-color leave their APIs by
adding collection methods for
sorting/filtering ,querying values of statistical significance and setting/getting different property values of color.

Because the collection methods are generic, you can manipulate any object that has enumerable keys and it will just
treat each value as a color token. It uses [Culori](https://github.com/Evercoder/culori) under the hood for conversions
and other color related
bells and whistles.

It is written in JavaScript but has type declarations for common built-in parameters and function
signatures.

### How does it work ?

Consider the typical parameter signature of a filtering function:

```ts

declare function filterByChroma(
collection: ArrayLike<ColorToken> | object | Map<any, ColorToken>,
    startSaturation?: number,
    endSaturation?: number,
    colorspace?: HueColorSpaces
    ): Array<ColorToken> | Map<any, ColorToken>;

```

Focus on the `collection` parameter and the return type of the above function declaration. All functions that took a collection color as an array prior v1.78.x can support this overload as well. These functions retain the structure of the passed in collection which was different in the previous versions since we'd only return arrays by default. This means if you pass in an object as a collection the function will return  a `Map`. The reasons why a `Map` is returned instead of a plain object are :

- `Map`s remember insertion order making it possible to sort colors and then insert them in the specified order (either ascending or descending). This behaviour is leveraged in the `sortBy` module when you pass in a plain object as a collection.
- Compliance with ES6. Plain objects where historically used as `Map`s but that is not their actual intended use. [See this article on MDN about the behaviour of plain objects compared against `Map`]().
- If an array (or `ArrayLike`) object is passed in to the , it will simply return a plain array.

#### Type diversity for color tokens

Culori accepts color tokens as plain objects, hexadecimal strings and CSS recognized named/serialized colors only. This package extends the data types which can be treated as valid tokens namely arrays/array-like objects,`Map`s , numbers and even boolean values.

```js
import { num2color, color2hex } from 'huetiful-js'

  let cssNamedColor = 'pink'
  let colorNumber = 5000
  let colorObject = { l: 50, c: 20, h: 40, mode: 'lch' }
  let colorObjectWithAlpha = { l: 50, c: 20, h: 40, alpha: 0.5, mode: 'lch' }
  let arrColor = ['rgb', 120, 80, 50]
  let arrColorWithAlpha = ['rgb', 120, 80, 50, 0.1]


        // Converting CSS named colors to hex
        console.log(color2hex(cssNamedColor))
        // #ffc0cb

        // Converting a number to hexadecimal
        console.log(num2color(colorNumber))
        // #001388

        // Converting a color object to a 6 character hex (without the alpha value)
        console.log(color2hex(colorObject))
        // #956d62

        // Converting a color object with an alpha property to an 8 character hex code (including the alpha channel)
        console.log(color2hex(colorObjectWithAlpha))
        // #956d6280

        // Converting an array of channel values to a 6 character hex code.
        console.log(color2hex(arrColor))
        // #785032

        // Converting an array of channel values (including the alpha channel) to an 8 character hex
        console.log(color2hex(arrColorWithAlpha))
        //#7850321a

```

By widening the options for valid color tokens, we can get a bit more creative since we're working with color in different flavours :smile: .

#### Working with collections of color

 Think of a scenario where we have collection of color tokens that we may want to filter by contrast and then
 have the result returned sorted by each color's hue angle in ascending order. In this example we will simply sort colors by luminance:

```js

  import { sortByLuminance } from "huetiful-js";

  let sample = [
  "#00ffdc",
  "#00ff78",
  "#00c000",
  "#007e00",
  "#164100",
  "#ffff00",
  "#310000",
  "#3e0000",
  "#4e0000",
  "#600000",
  "#720000",
  ];



        let sorted = sortByLuminance(sample)
        console.log(sorted)
        // [
        '#310000', '#3e0000',
        '#4e0000', '#600000',
        '#720000', '#164100',
        '#007e00', '#00c000',
        '#00ff78', '#00ffdc',
        '#ffff00'
        ]

        // Note that you can specify the order as either ascending (`asc`) or descending (`desc`). The default is
        ascending. :

        let sortedDescending = sortByLuminance(sample, "desc");
        console.log(sortedDescending)
        // [
        '#ffff00', '#00ffdc',
        '#00ff78', '#00c000',
        '#007e00', '#164100',
        '#720000', '#600000',
        '#4e0000', '#3e0000',
        '#310000'
        ]

 ```

[See the filterBy module](https://huetiful-js.com/api/filterBy) for examples on filtering colors and the sortBy module for sorting functions.

### Palette generators

A few simple palette generator functions are included in the library. One of my favourites is `hueShift` (as a color becomes lighter, its hue shifts up and darker when its hue shifts down.) .

```js
import { hueShift } from "huetiful-js";

let hueShiftedPalette = hueShift("#3e0000", {}, true);

        console.log(hueShiftedPalette);

        // [
        '#ffffe1', '#ffdca5',
        '#ca9a70', '#935c40',
        '#5c2418', '#3e0000',
        '#310000', '#34000f',
        '#38001e', '#3b002c',
        '#3b0c3a'
        ]



        ```

[See more palette generator functions](https://huetiful-js.com/api/generators)

### Predicates

Is this color coolðŸ¥¶ or warm ðŸ¥µ, is it achromatic (grayscale) or chromatic? Though its easy to tell colors apart visually when they're displayed on the screenðŸ“º it can be a bit confusing to tell colors apart using codeðŸ”¢.

Below is an example showing how to determine if a color is gray or not:

```js

import { isAchromatic } from "huetiful-js";
import { formatHex8, interpolate, samples } from "culori"


        isAchromatic('pink')
        // false

        let sample = [
        "#164100",
        "#ffff00",
        "#310000",
        'pink'
        ];

        console.log(map(sample, isAchromatic));

        // [false, false, false,false]

        isAchromatic('gray')
        // true



        // Here are using some of Culori's functions to demonstrate this example
        // we create an interpolation using black and white
        let f = interpolate(["black", "white"]);

        //We then create 12 evenly spaced samples and pass them to f as the `t` param required by an interpolating
        function.
        // Lastly we convert the color to hex for brevity for this example (otherwise color objects work fine too.)
        let grays = map(samples(12), (c) => formatHex8(f(c)));
        console.log(map(grays, isAchromatic));

        // The last two colors are false because we can't categorize black and white as achromatic.

        //
        [ false, true, true,
        true, true, true,
        true, true, true,
        true, true, false
        ]

        ```

Here's an exampleðŸŽ† showing how we can check if a color is cool using one of the predicate functions:

```js
import { isCool } from 'huetiful-js'

let sample = [
        "#00ffdc",
        "#00ff78",
        "#00c000"
        ];


        console.log(isCool(sample[0]));
        // false

        console.log(map(sample, isCool));

        // [ true, false, true]


        ```

        <br />

> **Tip**
>
> Another useðŸ‘· case would be passing the predicate to an array method like `filter` to filter a collection of colors removing colors that return false for the passed in predicate. In the following example we use is `isWarm` to only return warm colors:

 ```js
import { isWarm } from 'huetiful-js'

let sample = [
        "#00ffdc",
        "#00ff78",
        "#00c000"
        ];

        console.log(sample.filter(isWarm))
        // [ '#00ff78' ]

```

#### Querying properties of color and their values of statistical significance

Color has different properties which our eyes take note of in order to distinguish colors from each other even when they have certain perceived similarities. For example we can get the farthest hue angle in a collection against a specified color:

 ```js

        import { getFarthestHueFrom } from 'huetiful-js'
        let sample = [
        '#00ffdc',
        '#00ff78',
        '#00c000',
        '#007e00',
        '#164100',
        '#ffff00',
        '#310000',
        '#3e0000',
        '#4e0000',
        '#600000',
        '#720000',
        ]

        console.log(getFarthestHueFrom(sample, 'lime', 'lch'))
        // 112.60431681589854

```

### Functional with a hint of OOP via method chaining

Libraries like chroma.js popularized the read-manipulate-output chains when working with color. This library extends that idea by chaining collection methods to a `ColorArray` class. The actual class is not publicly exported because its still experimental but you can access it via the `load` wrapper function which simply takes the collection to bind to the `new ColorArray`. Color tokens also have a chain for binding them to all functions that take a single color as the initial parameter. This chain returns a `new Color` instance that's accessible via the `color` function. See the example below:

```js

import { load, color } from 'huetiful-js';

var myLazyChain = load([
        'blue',
        '#ff3c00',
        ['rgb', 200, 30, 50],
        { l: 5, c: 10, h: 60, mode: 'lch' }
        ])
        .sortByHue('desc')
        .output();

        console.log(myLazyChain);

        //['blue', ['rgb', 200, 30, 50], { l: 5, c: 10, h: 60, mode: 'lch' }, '#ff3c00'];

        var myLazyChainTwo = color(['hsl', 100, 0, 43]).isAchromatic();

        console.log(myLazyChainTwo);

        // true

```
