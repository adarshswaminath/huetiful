![Huetiful](./content/images/huetiful-logo.png)

A JavaScript library for simple color manipulations.

### What you can do with this package

- Filter arrays of color according to different properties i.e hue,saturation etc
- Sort arrays of colors according to their properties like luminance and hue.
- Create colors from template values like pastels, hueshifted color scales, paired schemes etc!
- Reference to all colors in the default TailwindCSS palette with every shade as a function!
- Categorize colors using their properties such as temperature and achromatic/chromatic .
- Get values of statistical significance (such as min and max hue values) from arrays of colors.

> #### Nice to know
