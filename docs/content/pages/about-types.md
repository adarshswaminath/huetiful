The library is written in TypeScript thus it comes along with rich TypeScript IntelliSense support for built-in parameters and return types. Thus there's no need to memorize the names of hues for the *tailwinColors* utility or schemes for the colorBrewer utilities etc.


You can look at all the types [here](https://github.com/prjctimg/huetiful/blob/main/src/paramTypes.d.ts)
