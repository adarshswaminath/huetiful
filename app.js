// Using trilerp and bilerp

// pairedScheme
// Paired scheme works with 3 colors; the baseColor, the derivedColor {calculated from the hueStep incrementation} and the tone white | black.
// The interpolation uses the baseColor as start and the tone as the middle value while the derivedColor is put at the other extremum
// During the interpolation
// we focus on the hue AND CHROMA CHANNELS
