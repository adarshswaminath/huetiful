## Introduction

I have been coding for almost 3 years now but it wasn't until this year that I made a lot of progress in my field (I still feel like a total newbie). It seems like yesterday when I was struggling with HTML and CSS syntax and the best I could do with JavaScript was  `console.log('Hello world')` . Its amazing how consistency can make it as if we have achieved things overnight. In this post I will share what I have learnt on my humble journey as a freelance developer.

To clear the air, I have no degree in computer science neither did I attend computer classes back in high school. Rather I was a life sciences student (I did Biology, Geography and Crop Science) but my passion was with computers ever since I was a kid. And because back then I couldn't afford to push my studies further, I decided to teach myself how to code since they were lready a lot of free resources online to help me get started. So why am I saying all of this ? I want to firmly establish that passion is the first thing you need to get started on what you put your mind to. Our backgrounds do not limit our potential whatsoever.

### You don't choose the language, the language chooses you

My first programming language was Python but I barely made it past 'Hello world' because the syntax looked difficult for me(plus I have a strong phobia towards reptiles). I then went on to try out Ruby (gave up on it because the development environment setup was tedious and frustrating), Dart but my PC wasn't powerful enough to run the required plugins in Android Studio. I finally settled for JavaScript because it required very minimal setup for me to get started. Plus the syntax just felt right. Why am I saying all this ? Don't let your PC hardware stop you from coding. Learn with what you have and build with you understand but don't forget to improve as situation allows you to.

### What happened after JavaScript ?

Okay, so I picked JS as my language of choice but, learning it was the real challenge. It was hard wrapping my head around the fundamental basics. In fact, **what I was doing** and **what I had in my mind** where **two different things**. My early learning days were very frustrating because I was obsessed with all these cool frameworks out there. I would binge watch tutorial videos on React and make something that worked but, without the tutorials, my coding skills were void. I learnt to focus on the language features and try to implement functionalities the hardway before resorting to a tool. Abstraction provided by third party tools is good for boosting productivity but its a red flag when you are just starting out.

### Hello world

As my understanding began to solidify a bit, I picked a niche of interest in frontend development and began to build my ideas in public. It wasn't easy getting over my imposter syndrome. I always felt like I was a phony or a copycat. However, I learnt to accept the fact that nothing is new under the sun and all ideas are derived. With time, I began to challenge myself to try and implement the same functionalities but using my own approach. It was hard but worth it. I would spend days debugging all because I barely understood what my code was actually doing. Every release was almost backwarward incompatible with previous versions. They were time I even questioned the relevancy of what I was doing. Fast forward a few months later, and the project has nearly 60 utilities in its API and still growing. I've learnt that consistency brings clarity. Keep going even if there's no one to applaud for you or acknowledge your progress. You're doing great and celebrate the small victories.

### Where did I get my motivation ?

Along the way I was motivated by other developers on Twitter who would share their progress and challenges in their learning path too. This encouraged me to connect with others and try to build my network. It felt awkward hopping into a complete stranger's comment section to introduce myself but with time I began to notice an increase in my profile metrics from Twitter, GitHub and even on the download counts [for this project on npm](https://npmjs.com/package/huetiful-js) ! In short all I'm saying is that being skilled without being connected equals to zero opportunities. People can't guess what you can do if you don't evangelise about it. Be loud and be bold. Do whatever it takes to make your presence felt!

### How can I get started with open source

The open source community is there to help you progress in your journey in tech if you open your doors. What pushed me to become active in open source was because I wanted to work with amazing and talented developers from around the world. And I'm glad to say that we're making progress! There's plenty of articles on the internet sharing tips on how to get started with open source too!

For those who want to start contributing to open source software but don't know where to start (every project out there seems daunting,I know!) feel free to checkout this open source project on GitHub where we are making a color manipulation library to help designers and creative coders work with color more programmatically using simple JavaScript functions to abstract over the complexities of color theory.

 Our community is still growing but there's plenty of issues and tasks to help you build up your confidence. You can [see the contributing guidelines here](https://github.com/prjctimg/huetiful/tree/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### It takes a community to build

I'd like to thank [@foss2cyber](https://github.com/foss2cyber), [@takanome-dev](https://github.com/takanome-dev) and [@adarshswaminath](https://github.com/adarshswaminath) for being my first contributors and helping make this effort thrive. This project has been boosted by your efforts indeed! And of course [@danburzo](https://github.com/danburzo) for open sourcing Culorijs on which this library is built on. The documentation site is an open source template made by @timlrx. Certain parts of the source code borrow from lodash and chroma-js on which this project initially depended on during its earlier releases. [See the list of open source licenses here](https://github.com/prjctimg/huetiful/tree/main/LICENSE.md)
